### Plural routes

```
GET    /posts
GET    /posts/1
POST   /posts
PUT    /posts/1
PATCH  /posts/1
DELETE /posts/1
```

### Filter

Use `.` to access deep properties

```
GET /posts?title=json-server&author=typicode
GET /posts?id=1&id=2
GET /comments?author.name=typicode
```

### Paginate

Use `_page` and optionally `_limit` to paginate returned data.

In the `Link` header you'll get `first`, `prev`, `next` and `last` links.

```
GET /posts?_page=7
GET /posts?_page=7&_limit=20
```

_10 items are returned by default_

### Sort

Add `_sort` and `_order` (ascending order by default)

```
GET /posts?_sort=views&_order=asc
GET /posts/1/comments?_sort=votes&_order=asc
```

For multiple fields, use the following format:

```
GET /posts?_sort=user,views&_order=desc,asc
```
